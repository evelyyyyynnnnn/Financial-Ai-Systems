For each company this fetches the two most recent 10-Ks, which is exactly the
input the risk-factor diff needs: the same registrant, one year apart, so a
change in Item 1A is a real change in disclosed risk rather than a difference
between two companies' drafting styles.

SEC's fair-access policy requires a User-Agent that names a real contact.
Set DATAKIT_UA or the fetch will be refused with a 403.
